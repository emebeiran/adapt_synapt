These are the codes for the paper "Contrasting the effects of adaptation and synaptic filtering on the timescale of dynamics in recurrent networks",
by Manuel Beiran and Srdjan Ostojic (submitted, 2018).

The file "lib_toymodel.py" is the library that includes all the functions I used in this project, and needs to be imported to run all other programs.

The other files reproduce the figures included in the manuscript.
